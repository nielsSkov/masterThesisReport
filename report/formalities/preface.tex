\chapter*{Preface}
\vspace{-12 pt}
This thesis made under the Control and Automation Master's Program at Aalborg University. The thesis was conducted in the fall of 2018 and supervised by John-Josef Leth, associate professor at Aalborg University.

The focus of the thesis has been to design and implement nonlinear control strategies for the cart pendulum and twin pendulum system. Each system is addressed in its own \textit{part} of the thesis.

The reader is expected to have an engineering level knowledge within mathematics and physics along with some prior knowledge within nonlinear control theory.

Special thanks to Kirstine Juul Elbæk, Michael Wodstrup Vandborg and Rasmus Gundorff Sæderup who were kind enough to help with revision of the text and Rasmus in addition for graphical design of the cover.
