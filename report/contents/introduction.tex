This project is concerned with developing nonlinear control strategies for a cart pendulum system and to apply these to the set-up provided in the Control and Automation Lab at Aalborg University (AAU).\\
The project is two part. The objective of the first part is to design a swing-up controller along with a stabilizing controller to catch the pendulum at the upright position.\\
In the second part an additional pendulum is attached to the cart in the setup making it a twin pendulum system. The idea is to estimate the additional state and ultimately stabilize the two pendulums in upright position.
