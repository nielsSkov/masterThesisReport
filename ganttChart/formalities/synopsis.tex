The aim of the project was to develop a sliding mode controller to stabilize a cart pendulum in its unstable equilibrium. Further to investigate a method for trajectory planning for a cart pendulum without friction. To find an interesting trajectory, a task was posed for the system to complete.\\
The system was modeled using both Newton's method and the energy method. The system was simulated using both simulink and matlab's ode45-solver. To aid in the process and to be able to visually show the results an animation was added to the simulations.\\
A sliding mode controller stabilizing the pendulum within $0.05$\fxnote{check value of real stability angle} rad was designed and implemented successfully. The posed task for trajectory planning was solved with a minor exception of bringing the pendulum to a compete stop at the end.
